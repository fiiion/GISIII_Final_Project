```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's make sure everything went as expected in the data wrangling process:

```{r pulling in chi income data}

c_inc <- st_read("city_income_data/chi/chi_inc.shp")
plot(c_inc)

# success!

```

Nice! Let's pull in the other files:

```{r pulling in mpls and sd income data}

sd_inc <- st_read("city_income_data/sd/sd_inc.shp")
plot(sd_inc)
glimpse(sd_inc)

m_inc <- st_read("city_income_data/mpls/mpls_inc.shp")
plot(m_inc)

```

Oh, it looks like I never ran the line that added the "sd" city name to the data set. If it's important, I can add it later. But worth noting!
