This is my first package in R, made for GISIII lab 7. In it I made 2 scripts, which house some of the functions I'm using for my final project. 

Ideally, I would be able to scale the project up to do any city, but I've run into some challenges. In particular, I have not found a database with all the US city boundaries, as of yet. Relatedly, there are some variables in my mapping process that are city-dependent, making it more difficult to automate.
